# Data Analysis 📚
These next few pages will look at the following measures for analysing data:

1. Min & Max values
2. Mean
3. Median
4. Frequency
5. Mode

We will use the textbook to examine the _algorithms_ and code for computing these measures. 

💡 _Note: an algorithm is a step by step approach to solving a problem._
 
For each example we will use the list from the previous problem set, or a slight variation of it.

````py
myList = [1, 19, 27, 8, 5, 9]
````


## Minimum and Maximum values (p80) 👨‍💻

- In the previous problem set, we sorted a list in ascending order and saw that we could extract the first value _(minimum)_ and the last value _(maximum)_ using the code below.

````py
# 1. Min and Max values

myList = [1, 19, 27, 8, 5, 9]

myList.sort()
minValue = myList[0]
maxValue = myList[-1]
print(minValue)
print(maxValue)
````
👉 Run the code above in `main.py` to check the output is correct.

- Python also has built-in function to find the _Min_ and _Max_ values in a list. 

👉 Try the following example in `main.py`.

````py
myList = [1, 19, 27, 8, 5, 9]

minValue = min(myList)
maxValue = max(myList)
print(minValue)
print(maxValue)
````

- We can also use a `for` loop to manually compute the _Min_ and _Max_ values without using any built-in functions. _(Though I'm not sure why I'd bother doing this. 🤷‍♂️)_

- First we set the the variables `minValue` and `maxValue` to the same value as the first item in the list `[0]`.
- We then iterate through the list, and if any item is greater than the value stored in the current `maxValue` variable or less than the value stored in the current `minValue` variable, we overwrite that variable's value with teh new value found.

👉 Try the following:

````py
myList = [1, 19, 27, 8, 5, 9]

minValue = myList[0]
maxValue = myList[0]

for item in myList:
  if item < minValue:
    minValue = item
  if item > maxValue:
    maxValue = item
print(minValue)
print(maxValue)
````
