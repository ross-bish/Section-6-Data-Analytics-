# Frequency (p82) 📚

- The number of times an item appears in a data set is called its _Frequency_.
- This can apply to strings, characters, numbers, etc.
- Frequency is often required for the _'visualisation'_ of data _(e.g. bar charts)_.

For this problem we will use a list that contains strings.

````py
myList = ["red","blue","blue","red","green","red","red"]

````

## Finding the frequency 👨‍💻 

1. Follow the instruction on page 82 and see if you can get your code to work correctly.
2. Use the sections given in `main.py` to separate your code.
3. Use `# comments` to help explain what your code is doing.

````py
# ------------------------
# 4. Finding the frequency

4. The goal is to create two new lists `colourNames = []` and `colourCount = []` that can be used later to create bar charts.
