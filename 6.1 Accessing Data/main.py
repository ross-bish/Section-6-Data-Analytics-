# Title: Accessing Data
# Date: 22/2/23

### Part A - Creating a Text file



# The "w" argument indicates write
# The "a" argument indicates append (add to end of file)
# The "r" argument indicates read








### Part B - Creating a CSV file

# The "w" argument indicates write



# The "r" argument indicates read
# reads the info as a single string



# separates string into list based on specified delimiter (in this case comma " , ") 




### Note: the items in the list are strings. This is because the file.read() function always reads data as a string. 

### We can use list-comprehension to convert the data in our list into an int or float or suitable data type.



# Uses [ ] to show it is returning a list






### Note: the word "item" appears twice. This is a variable name and it needs to be the same in both locations in the line of code.
