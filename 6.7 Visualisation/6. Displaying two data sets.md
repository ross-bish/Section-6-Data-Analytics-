# Displaying two data sets on the same graph ðŸ“š

- Sometimes we may want to have two plots overlayed on the same graph.
- This allows us to compare them and examine any trends or relationships that are not visible when looking at them seratately.
- When comparing two lists, we assume that the items at each index position correspond  with eachother. _(i.e. `names[0]`, `ages[0]`and `numBS[0]` are assumed to all correspond to the same student.)_

### Task 1
ðŸ‘‰ Type up the code from _page 87_ of your textbook and see if you can overlay both sets of data `ages[0]`and `numBS[0]`on one graph.

ðŸ’¡ _Note: that `matplotlib` used the same y-axis for both sets of data. Be careful of this, because if the scales were significantly different it would be difficult to read._

## Adding a graph legend 

What if we want to have two or more sets of data on the one graph, how could we tell them apart?

- The code below allows us to add a legend to our graph. 

### Task 2
ðŸ‘‰ See if you can add the code below to the graph.

````py
plt.legend(["Num Brothers & Sisters", "Age"])
````

ðŸ’¡ _Note: A legend takes a list as its argument, where the order of items in the list corresponds to the order of the lists plotted on the y-axis._
