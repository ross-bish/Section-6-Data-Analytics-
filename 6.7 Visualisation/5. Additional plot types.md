# Additional plot types 📚

The function `plt.plot()` only requires one list as an argument.

However, the following graphs
- Bar charts 
- Scatter plots 
- Pie charts 
  
...all require two arguments, both of which must be lists!

## Bar Charts 📊

👉 Type up the code from _page 86_ of your textbook and see if you can create a Bar Chart.

## Scatter Plot 📈
👉 Type up the code from _page 87_ of your textbook and see if you can create a Scatter Plot.

## Pie Charts 🥧
- When calculating the size of a pie chart segment, we usually need to scale the values so that they all sum to 360⁰.
- `matplotlib` does this calculation for us. 😎
- The code for a pie chart is almost the same as that for a scatter plot, except we need to remove the x and y-axis labels, and use the second argument in `plt.pie()` as a keyword argument.
