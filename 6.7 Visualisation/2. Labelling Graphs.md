We can add labels to the title and the axes of our graphs. 

- In the following code, `numBS` represents the number of brothers and sisters of each student in a group.

- Enter the code below into `main.py` and see what output you can produce.

````py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

numBS = [1,2.5,4,3,2.5,2]
