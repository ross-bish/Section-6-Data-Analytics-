# Pre-Processing Data 📚

Pre-processing data is the stage where we apply techniques to ensure that data is of good quality.

Typical issues that can arise in data quality include:

- Missing data.
- Data that is out of range.
- Non validated data.
- Incorrect data structure.

Why do these issues arise in the first place?

- Poor validation in the code reading the data.
- Manual entry of data from a paper source.
- Typos.

## Task 👨‍💻
1. Follow the instruction on pages 78 - 79 and see if you can get your code to work correctly.
2. Use the sections given in `main.py` to separate your code.
````py
### Sorting

### Removing Data

### Imputation
````
3. Use `# comments` to help explain what your code is doing.


## Question to make you think? 🤔

What do you think might  be a more appropriate value to _impute_ for the erroneous values of number of brothers and sisters `numBS`?
